				<p> Well… No, unfortunately not. This installation was painted by French artist Jeff Aérosol, commissioned by Northeastern University. Banksy is a British street artist, who’s real identity is unknown. Their work typically consists of a black and white portrait (usually children), with emphasized bits of red paint. The work always shows up unannounced, on arbitrary public structures - like walls, or the sides of buildings. These works are usually socially relevant, and a political/culture statement. As we can see in the above image, all of these elements are consistent in Jeff’s work. Event the placement of the piece - on a seemingly random slab of concrete, in inactive area of campus, is similar to Banksy’s. </p>
