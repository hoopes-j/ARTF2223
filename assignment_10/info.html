				Elevators are a very complex invention that we take advantage of every day, and the safety of them is even more under-appreciated. Until Elisha Otis invented his patented safety break in 1852,  elevator travel was very dangerous and not practical enough to be widely implemented. Otis’ brakes stopped the elevator car in case a cable snapped, bolstering the public’s confidence in this new device. The device was revealed at America’s first world fair in New York City, and was comprised of a spring attached to the lifting cable, as well as the hoist platform. When a cable broke, the springs would snap open and trigger beams to bring the platform to a full stop.  While Otis did not design the first elevator, his addition popularized and normalized the elevator. Without it, skyscrapers (and pretty much any building over 5 floors, would not be a reality.
